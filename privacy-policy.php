<br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<strong>In Short: </strong>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.

<br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<strong>In Short: </strong>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
<br>
<br>
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
<br>
<br>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

<br>
<strong>In Short: </strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
<br>
<br>
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<strong>In Short: </strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
<br><br>
In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
<br><br>
If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
<br>
If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
<br>
If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.
<br>
<br>
  <strong>Account Information</strong>
<br><br>
If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
  <ul><li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li></ul>
  <br>
  Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Opting out of email marketing:</strong>You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Access your account settings and update your preferences.
      </li>
    </ul>
<br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. 
<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>8. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<strong>In Short: </strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
<br>
<br>
We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
<br>
